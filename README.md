# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

In the Kicksarting with Excel project, we are helping Louise determine how much money she will need to raise for a play she has. You are also helping her determine when to launch the play. Given an Excel sheet with data of previous kickstarters with varying genres, outcomes, and amount of money raised, we are able to determine the best time and amount of money that so Louise can have a successful play.   

## Analysis and Challenges

This project is meant to help learn about Excel and the common functions used in data analytics. While learning about the functions, basic statistical definitions are learned. After learning the new definitions, pivot tables, graphs and charts are learned to complete the analytics with visualization. After learning about functions, basic statistical definitions, and visualization, we were able to find the best time Louise should launch her play and the best amount of money to raise for the play. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
With the learning of pivot tables, it was easy to make the graph the determine the best launch date. The main challenge was being able to find the column for the months for the data. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The main challenge was remembering to use the '$' and using CountIfs instead of CountIf. For the most part, I was able to get the graph right. Unfortunately something does not look right for the graph at the 50000 or more goal and was unable to figure out how to fix it. Thankfully, the rest was pretty easy. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

One conclusion that can be drawn is that the best time to launch is between April and August. There are over 60 successful plays each month in that time range.

Another conclusion that can be drawn is that December has roughly a 50 percent chance of succeeding. With 37 successes and 35 fails, December is one of the months not to launch a play.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

The best amount to raise is less 5000 dollars. When plays had a goal of less than 5000 dollars, there is a 75 percent rate of success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

The only limitation that I see is that there is some extra data that was not used in the analytics and visualizations so at times it was hard to see all the needed data without zooming out, making it hard to see the data.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

In the Outcomes based on Goals, a bar or pie chart could have been used if looking only at the number of successful or failed plays. A bar chart could also have been used for Outcomes based on Launch Date with the number of successful or failed plays.

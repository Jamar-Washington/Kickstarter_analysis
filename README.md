# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

In the Kicksarting with Excel project, we are helping Louise determine how much money she will need to raise for a play she has. You are also helping her determine when to launch the play. Given an Excel sheet with data of previous kickstarters with varying genres, outcomes, and amount of money raised, we are able to determine the best time and amount of money that so Louise can have a successful play.   

### Tools used in the project

## Analysis

There are a few conclusions that can be drawn from the results. One conclusion that can be drawn is that the best time to launch is between April and August. There are over 60 successful plays each month in that time range. Another conclusion that can be drawn is that December has roughly a 50 percent chance of succeeding. With 37 successes and 35 fails, December is one of the months not to launch a play.

Looking at the graph show us that the best amount to raise is 5000 dollars or less. When plays had a goal of less than 5000 dollars, there is a 75 percent rate of success.

There is some extra data that was not used in the analytics and visualizations so at times, zooming out is the only way to see the data.. A filter would help.

In the Outcomes based on Goals, a bar or pie chart could have been used if looking only at the number of successful or failed plays. A bar chart could also have been used for Outcomes based on Launch Date with the number of successful or failed plays.
